# lumen-backend-app

A simple boilerplate project that may be a good starting point for PHP applications. 

This project includes support for Docker, CI/CD through CircleCI + AWS (feel free to change what suits your needs better) and REST APIs with JWT Auth.

Also, the persistence layer follows the Repository pattern and has built-in support for Cache management as well as a third-party notification/logging client (Sentry).
